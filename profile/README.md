# We are AutoMec!
Welcome to our profile! 
We are a student organization that is a part of [Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/en/dem/) who specializes on robotics and automation.\
Currently, we divide ourselves into two projects, the [autonomous car](https://github.com/AutomecUA/AutoMec-AD) and the autonomous drone, although new projects are always welcome!\
We also give workshop on a frequent basis to teach some skills we learned along the way. One example is the [Vision and ROS Workshop](https://github.com/AutomecUA/VisionAndRosWorkshop). \
You can find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/automec.dem/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/automec.ua/). You can always [e-mail us](mailto:dem-automec@ua.pt) if you prefer. \
See you around!
